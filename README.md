# WEEK 10 :

create a TDD project in rails
to start the test you need to type 
```
rspec --format doc
```

I create the test before do something.
After that I create the ElevatorMedia module on lib directory.
Every time I add something I do a test and check what is wrong on the code.
after all test pass, I simplify de code.

## Test 1:
the first test is to check if the streamer call will be create
## Test 2:
the second test is to check if the call function is there and if we have no problem to call it
the response is replace by a mock so is a fack response.

## Test 3:
the third test is to check if the content is html and contain <div> and </div>
that will means is a html stuff

## other test:

I create a test to get if the table address contain the minimum of input
after that I create a test to get if the index can be render and
the last test I made is to verify of if you are a normal user you can't go on intervention

Twilio

In order to receive a message from Twilio, you will have to update the status of the elevator to "intervention".
To do this you need to access the elevator panel in the admin page. You then edit the elevator's staus. 
This will send a text message to the technician.

Theses tickets will be sent to the Sales representative via email and in the zendesk dashboard.

IBM Watson

The IBM Watson works by gathering the text data, converting it to an audio file wich can be played in the admin panel pressing the "play" button.
Every time the user is changed, the audio will be updated to say the user's name. 
If the database is changed, the audio will also be updated.

In order to receive a slack notification in the channel "#elevator_operations", you will have to change the status of an elevator on
the elevator panel in the admin page. Once you edited the status, this will send a message via slack.

Just make sure that the email is valid, otherwise nothing will be sent.
